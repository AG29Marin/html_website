                It turns out that the world, for all its imperfections, is in a much better state than we might think. 
                That doesn't mean there aren't real concerns. 
                But when we worry about everything all the time instead of embracing a worldview based on facts, 
                we can lose our ability to focus on the things that threaten us most.
